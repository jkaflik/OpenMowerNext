## Getting Started

To get started with project development, you should have overall sense of [ROS](https://ros.org/).
If you are not familiar with ROS, you can start with [ROS2 tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/iron/Tutorials.html).

## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the main project repository to your own GitHub account.
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the project's GitHub page and click the 'Fork' button
    ```

2. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/OpenMowerNext.git
    ```

3. **Set Up ROS2**: Ensure you have ROS2 installed and configured on your system.

    a. **Devcontainer**: follow [devcontainer guide](./devcontainer) to setup ROS2 development environment using Devcontainer.

    ::: info
    This section is not complete yet. It will be updated as the project progresses.
    There is no instruction how to setup ROS2 workspace standalone yet. For a reference, [Dockerfile](https://github.com/jkaflik/OpenMowerNext/blob/main/Dockerfile) can be used.
